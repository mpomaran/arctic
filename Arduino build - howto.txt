In order to build for Arduino on Windows, please do following:

1. Install arduino 1.0.5  - newer versions do not work correctly on Windows 10
2. Install MinGW on c:\mingw
3. Run configure.bat, specify MinGW Make as a build system and "build" as a build directory, specify file from toolchain/ArduinoToolchin as a cross-compiling toolchain
4. Click configure && build
5. Go to the build directory
6. Type c:\MinGW\bin\mingw32-make VERBOSE=1

You should be good to go
